Driver Trend Analysis
## Overview 
In this analysis I looked at ride sharing data among three classifications of city Rural, Urban, and Suburban.  I was given information on number of rides, drivers, and fares.  From this information I was able to pull out average fare amount per ride and driver for each city type. 

## Results
Below is a chart that show the breakdown by city for the metrics discussed above.

When examining the chart it becomes apparent that Urban cities have a larger volume of drives, rides, and total fares.  In contrast to both suburban and rural cities.  This large quantity of smaller trips is likely what is driving down the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. This would lead one to conclude that it is more profitable to be an established driver in a smaller community, but you would be competing more aggresively for riders.

The next chart graphs the tracks the total fares earned by city type from January through April.

As you can see the total revenue for Urban is far above Suburban and Rural, as was clear with the first chart.  It does seem that travel trends for all three city types is generally similar throughout the year.

## Summary

When looking at the data the following steps could be taken.
 * In Urban cities there is consistenly more ride share business.  With this comes a higer volume of drivers and lower per ride wages 
 * Ridership seems to be at its highest in all three city types during the second half of February and first half of March.  This could be dure to inclement weather.
 * The higher average fare per ride and per driver for suburban and rural areas could be attributed to longer drives and less options for public transportation.  
 
 It would make sense to redistribute highly rated drivers from urban area to suburban area, but I would caution against relocating any drivers to more Rural areas becuase the cost to the driver may negate the increase in per trip rate.  It also may become clear that the low level of demand is fully serviced by the fewer drivers in the area.  It would be interesting to look at when the peaks and valley's by time of day differed among the three city types.
